1. Calculate error for state forecast based on cluster centroid dist
2. take weighted decompostion for the fft components
3. Refine noise untill we acheive the white noise
4. For each segment fetures where extracted and states were assigned now can we reconsruct the signal based on the extracted features ?
5. perform second level of clustering purely based on the slop
